# Lingo

This is a game called Lingo where the players guess letters in order to reveal a whole word. I've made this project for my RAD-course.

The project consists of:
- Unit testing by PhpUnit
- Performance/security coverage by Psalm & SonarCloud
- Automatic deployment by GitHub Actions


Instructions on how to run the project:
1. Clone/download the project
2. Run `npm ci`
3. Run `php artisan migrate:refresh`
4. Start the app by running `php artisan serve`
